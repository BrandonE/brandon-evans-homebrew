Hello. I am [Brandon Evans](http://www.brandonevans.org/), a student studying computer science. After starting a [project](http://code.google.com/p/brandon-evans-tas/) for [TASVideos.org](http://tasvideos.org/), I have decided to branch off into the world of video game development, or homebrew. I am currently learning how to develop NES games in 6502 assembly. I will hopefully create a simple project shortly after.
